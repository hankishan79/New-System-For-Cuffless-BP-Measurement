# New-System-For-Cuffless-BP-Measurement
A New System for Cuffless Blood Pressure Measurement

This project focuses on the development of a wristwatch-based system for continuous blood pressure monitoring. The system utilizes a combination of photoplethysmography (PPG), electrocardiography (ECG), and speech signals to estimate systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Introduction
High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure can aid in early detection and management of hypertension. This project aims to provide a cuffless and non-invasive method for continuous blood pressure measurement using wearable devices.

Features
Estimation of systolic and diastolic blood pressure using PPG, ECG, and speech signals
Integration of a simple mathematical model for real-time blood pressure estimation
User-friendly wristwatch-based system for convenient monitoring
Compatibility with existing wearable devices
Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/continuous-bp-monitoring.git
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the hardware components according to the provided instructions.
Usage
Launch the monitoring system software on your wristwatch device.
Ensure that the PPG and ECG sensors are properly placed and connected.
Begin speaking into the device's microphone to capture speech signals.
The system will process the signals and provide continuous estimates of systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
Results
The performance of the system was evaluated using a dataset of 22 subjects, with ages ranging from 19 to 49 years. The obtained results showed a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.6788 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.1, indicating a significant correlation between the estimated and actual blood pressure values. The study demonstrated the potential of the proposed methodology for accurate and non-invasive continuous blood pressure monitoring.
